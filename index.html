   <h1>All About My UCF Experience!</h1>
   <h2>How did I get here? Well let's take a look with a timeline!</h2>

        <div class="grid-item 1"><strong>The Uh-OH</strong><br><em>July 2020</em></div>
        <div class="grid-item 2">I’m a Direct Connect graduate from Valencia college where I got my associate in art’s degree there in July of 2020. My accomplishment was short lived because the following semester I started UCF online classes for my bachelor’s. immediately. This was in addition to taking summer classes consecutively since I began college in 2017. I know call me a workaholic, but I’m just passionate. The pandemic courses taught me to appreciate online classes and the structure and organization they usually provide. I took electives at Valencia that were gearing me towards a graphic design BA because that was my career goal at the time.</div>
