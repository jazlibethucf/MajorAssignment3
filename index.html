                <li>I’m a Direct Connect graduate from Valencia college where I got my associate in art’s degree there in July of 2020.</li>
                <li>My accomplishment was short lived because the following semester I started UCF online classes for my bachelor’s immediately after.</li>
                <li>I took electives at Valencia that were gearing me towards a graphic design BA because that was my career goal at the time.</li>

                <li>Additionally, portfolio review is mandatory and is only offered once a year for the graphic design track <em>(unlike studio art *eyeroll*)</em>.</li>
                <li>I didn’t pass my portfolio and I had to make a decision. Do I wait another year to make better artwork and try again or declare a different major to try and graduate sooner?</li>
                <li>Answer: The answer is the latter.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>I ended up choosing Visual Arts Management as my new major and Digital Media as my minor.</li>
                <li>I chose that major and minor because I didn't hate the idea of it and my credits transfered over from Valencia.</li>

    <h2>My Forseeable Future</h2>
    <p>I have an internship at the <em>Albin Polasek Museum & Sculpture Gardens</em> coming this summer. Last summer I interned at the Orlando Museum of Art and both internships are not for college credit. I believe in just getting as much experience as possible until I graduate next year.

    <h2>Decisions Along The Way</h2>
    <div class="future">
        <ul>
            <li>I decided to change my major to graduate sooner because I felt like being a graphic designer wasn't meant to be. t wasn’t a mistake to haven't passed the portfolio review because I feel like it steered me in the direction of a future I am happy and content with.</li>
            <li>Another decision I made was to work a job while in school. Initially I was part-time school, part-time job, but due to the pandemic and my living situation I am noW full-time job and part-time school. Working is a necessity for me and for my situation.</li>
            <li>Why part-time school if I'd prefer to graduate sooner? This is because 3 classes is difficult to balance already, I really couldn’t imagine taking 4 or more classes while working, I respect those who do. My mental health comes first in this situation.</li>
