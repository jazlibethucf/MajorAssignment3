                <li>I’m a Direct Connect graduate from Valencia college where I got my associate in art’s degree there in July of 2020.</li>
                <li>My accomplishment was short lived because the following semester I started UCF online classes for my bachelor’s immediately after.</li>
                <li>I took electives at Valencia that were gearing me towards a graphic design BA because that was my career goal at the time.</li>

                <li>I took Into to Computer Art which was a very fun and challenging class.</li>
                <li>I was also preparing to turn in my online portfolio the following Spring semester in order to get into the program.</li>

                <li>I didn’t pass my portfolio and I had to make a decision. Do I wait another year to make better artwork and try again or declare a different major to try and graduate sooner?</li>
                <li>Answer: The answer is the latter.</li>

                <li>I chose that major and minor because I didn't hate the idea of it and my credits transfered over from Valencia.</li>
                <li><em>But not my foreign language credits, I'm still mad about that.</em></li>

                </li>

    <h2>My Forseeable Future</h2>
    <!-- Still needs editing from here and so on -->
    <p>Oh another thing im mad about. I have a good amount of upper level electives I need and they are all scheduled for the same days and times for fall semester thus extending my graduation date. (insert upside down smiley face here).
    </p>

    <h2>Decisions Along The Way</h2>
    <p>
        Changing my major in order to graduate sooner was a decision I made because I wasn’t fully in love with being a graphic designer as a career. I felt pressured to go to college in the first place, but I feel like I would feel lost in life if I never went in the first place. I took two basic interests I had from high school: information technology and art and put them together to declare a goal of graphic design as a future for myself. It wasn’t a mistake to do that because I feel like it steered me in the direction of a future I am happy and content with. I think it’s important to mention the entire time I’ve been in college I have been working. Initially I was part-time school, part-time job, but due to the pandemic and my living situation I am noW full-time job and part-time school. Which makes the whole finishing school thing slower which can be frustrating but there’s only so much my mind can handle. Another decision I made was to work a job while in school. Its just cause my home situation calls for that. I need to depend on myself.
        
        Why part-time school though? Because 3 classes is killer already, I really couldn’t imagine taking 4 or more classes while working. If I didn’t have to work I might take 4 classes, but I can’t so it isn’t an option. My mental health comes first in this situation.
