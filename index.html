   <h1>All About My UCF Experience!</h1>
   <h2>How did I get here? Well let's take a look with a timeline!</h2>

    <div class="grid">
        <div class="grid-item 1"><strong>The Uh-OH</strong><br><em>Prior-July 2020</em></div>
        <div class="grid-item 2">
            <ul>
                <li>I’m a Direct Connect graduate from Valencia college where I got my associate in art’s degree there in July of 2020.</li>
                <li>My accomplishment was short lived because the following semester I started UCF online classes for my bachelor’s immediately after.</li>
                <li>I took electives at Valencia that were gearing me towards a graphic design BA because that was my career goal at the time.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item 3"><strong>The Dive</strong><br><em>August 2020-December 2020</em></div>
        <div class="grid-item 3">
            <ul>
                <li>I took Into to Computer Art which was a very fun and challenging class.</li>
                <li>I was also preparing to turn in my online portfolio the following Spring semester in order to get into the program.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item 5"><strong>How The Tables</strong><br><em>January 2021-April 2021</em></div>
        <div class="grid-item 6">
            <ul>
                <li>Additionally, portfolio review is mandatory and is only offered once a year for the graphic design track <em>(unlike studio art *eyeroll*)</em>.</li>
                <li>I didn’t pass my portfolio and I had to make a decision. Do I wait another year to make better artwork and try again or declare a different major to try and graduate sooner?</li>
                <li>Answer: The answer is the latter.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="grid-item 10">
            <ul>
                <li>I ended up choosing Visual Arts Management as my new major and Digital Media as my minor.</li>
                <li>I chose that major and minor because I didn't hate the idea of it and my credits transfered over from Valencia.</li>
                <li><em>But not my foreign language credits, I'm still mad about that.</em></li>
            </ul>
